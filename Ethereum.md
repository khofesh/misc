# Accidently sent ETH with BEP20 transfer network

So, I accidently withdraw ETH from tokocrypto using BEP20 network.

by default, metamask is using ethereum mainnet.

to see your ETH, you have to add BSC (Binance Smart Chain) main network.

then add this token to your BSC wallet https://bscscan.com/token/0x2170ed0880ac9a755fd29b2688956bd959f933f8 by copying the contract address.
